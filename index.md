### CPSC 120

* Lab 2

    LAB 2 Part 1: For me I enjoyed doing lab 2 because it was the beginning of my computer science journey. In this lab I got to learn how to use the basics of C++ and github. This included many commands we use now like git add and git commit.
Lab 4

    LAB 4 Part 1: I enjoyed doing lab 4 because it allowed me to put what I had already learned on paper, and make an actual code of it. This code allowed me to ask the user 2 dates, and then give the amount of days between the two. Something more advanced than I had done before, however it was still very enjoyable to make.

Lab 5:

    LAB 5 Part 1: This was the sandwich maker. The user would simply put in what they want on their sandwich and the program would run to form an order. It was the first time using command line arguments and was one of my favorite programs to work on.
